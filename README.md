PokéPull is a full-stack game I decided to make for fun since I am currently learning front-end development and have been getting back into Pokémon recently. This inspiration came from a Roblox game that I played called Sol's rng, and I decided to try to make this for fun.

# Frameworks

React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Goals
I will be attempting to upload this project onto a server for others to play, since I thought it would be fun to make something for others to enjoy

Initial Goal
To have the user press a button and cycle through a few preview Pokémon to entice the player and land on their selected Pokémon to fill their Pokedex

further goals
to have this not locally run, but on a server in the future 
to maybe have a fighting feature among others, but that seems like a lot right now
gain familiarity with working with API and use this in-depth knowledge to expand my knowledge of developing
