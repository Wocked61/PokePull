# PokéPull

PokéPull is a full-stack game I decided to make for fun since I am currently learning front-end development and have been getting back into Pokémon recently. This inspiration came from a Roblox game that I played called Sol's rng, and I decided to try to make this for fun.

#Frameworks

React, HTML, CSS, Javasctipt

## Goals
I will be attempting to be uploading this project onto a server for others to play since I thought it would be fun to make something for others to enjoy
